# Web-wing - Interactive Transonic Wing Design App

The physics-embedded transfer learning for transonic wing is demonstrated with a simple interactive app. You can modify the airfoil geometry, wing planform geometry, and wing operating conditions to see what will happed on the wing surface flow field. Feel free to play with it, and your knowledge on wing aerodynamics will grow.

The next step of the app is a gradient optimization tool for wing performance, which will come soon.
